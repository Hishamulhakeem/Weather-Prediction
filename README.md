Weather Prediction Application

This application predicts weather conditions for different cities based on machine learning models. The app is built with Python and Streamlit, providing an easy-to-use interface to interact with the model and obtain real-time weather predictions.

Features:
- Predicts weather for cities like Austin and Bengaluru
- Uses machine learning models trained using scikit-learn
- Interactive and simple user interface with Streamlit

Setup:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Hishamulhakeem/Weather-Prediction.git
   cd Weather-Prediction

2. Install the required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Streamlit app locally:
   streamlit run stream.py

4. Pre-trained model files:
   - ClassifierAustin.pkl (Austin weather model)
   - ClassifierBengaluru.pkl (Bengaluru weather model)
